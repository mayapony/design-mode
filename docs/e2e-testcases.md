# Design Mode — E2E Test Cases

Run this checklist before every release. Build first:

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

Load `packages/extension/dist/` into `chrome://extensions` (Developer mode → Load unpacked).
Open any non-trivial site (a marketing landing page works well — e.g. https://stripe.com,
https://vercel.com, https://linear.app). Walk every phase below.

A row passes only if the **Expected Result** matches **exactly**. Anything ambiguous, retest
before ticking.

> **Tip — silent-fail canary.** If a style edit looks like it didn't land, open the page's
> DevTools console and run `localStorage.setItem('dm-debug', '1')`. Subsequent style edits
> whose computed value didn't move will log a `[design-mode] no-op style edit` warning so
> you can spot specificity / parsing issues. Clear with `localStorage.removeItem('dm-debug')`.

## Phase 0 — Activation & lifecycle

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 0.1  | Extension loads | Load unpacked → check the icon in the toolbar | Design Mode icon appears, no error in `chrome://extensions` |
| 0.2  | Side panel opens | Click the toolbar icon | Side panel slides in on the right |
| 0.3  | Auto-activate inspect | Open the side panel for the first time | The page cursor becomes the **Design Mode app icon** (the default; Settings → Page cursor → Off falls back to a plain crosshair); Design tab shows the page-context view (`<body>` selected with a "Page" indicator chip) |
| 0.4  | Pinned-tab behaviour | Open the panel on tab A, switch to tab B | The panel keeps showing data for tab A (it pins to the tab where it was opened) |
| 0.5  | Side-panel close → inspect off | Close the side panel | The Design Mode page cursor disappears within ~50ms; hover overlays don't follow the mouse anymore |
| 0.6  | Re-open keeps state | Re-open the panel on the same URL | Previously-applied edits are replayed (delete / hide / styles); changes badge counts match |
| 0.7  | Page reload preserves changes | Make 3 style edits + 1 hide + 1 delete, reload | All 5 are re-applied automatically when the panel re-opens |
| 0.8  | URL navigation isolates | Navigate to a different URL in the same tab | Changes from URL A do **not** apply to URL B; Changes tab resets |
| 0.9  | Browser-session boundary | Close & reopen browser | Session storage is cleared (per `chrome.storage.session` semantics) — fresh state |
| 0.10 | Theme toggle | Click sun/moon in header | Side panel + page overlays switch theme; persists across reloads |
| 0.11 | Side-panel toggle shortcut | Check `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`, assigning `Alt+D` if Chrome left the manifest suggestion blank; press it | Opens Design Mode on the current launch surface (default: side panel). Firefox: sidebar |
| 0.12 | Unscriptable page | Open the panel on a `chrome://` page, the Chrome Web Store, or a devtools page (on Firefox: an `about:` page such as `about:addons`) | No "cannot be scripted" / "could not establish connection" error spam in the background console; the panel shows a disabled / empty state, not a crash |

---

## Phase 0.5 — Settings panel

Open via the gear icon in the side-panel header. All settings persist via `chrome.storage.local`
unless noted otherwise. **MCP configuration (mode, port, token, agent setup) is no longer here —
it lives on its own MCP page (Phase 0.7), opened from the header MCP chip.**

| #     | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 0.5.1 | Open / close | Click gear → click gear again | Settings view replaces the tabs; clicking again returns to the previous tab |
| 0.5.2 | Theme picker (system / dark / light) | Pick each | Side panel + page overlays update; persists across reloads |
| 0.5.3 | Color format (HEX / RGBA / HSL) | Switch each option | All colour text inputs in the Design tab re-render in the chosen format on next selection; existing rules keep their stored format |
| 0.5.4 | Screenshot capture mode | Switch among Clipboard / Download / Both | Subsequent camera-button screenshots respect the mode |
| 0.5.5 | Inspector hover colour | Pick a custom colour (e.g. green) | Hover overlay repaints **live** (no reload) in the new colour; the swatch shows its hex |
| 0.5.6 | Inspector selection colour | Pick a custom colour | Selection overlay repaints **live** in the new colour; swatch shows its hex |
| 0.5.7 | No MCP section in Settings | Open Settings | The MCP Server card and "Set up your agent" card are **absent** — only editor preferences remain |
| 0.5.8 | Reset to defaults | Click Reset | Theme back to system, colour format to HEX, all four overlay colours (hover / selection / margin / padding) to defaults, MCP port to default, page cursor back to On, launch surface back to Side panel (Chrome) |
| 0.5.9 | Inspector margin overlay colour | Pick a custom colour | Margin bands on the hover/selection overlay render in it and repaint live (default `#FF6363`) |
| 0.5.10| Inspector padding overlay colour | Pick a custom colour | Padding bands render in it and repaint live (default `#7CC886`); the ↺ Reset link beside the overlay colours restores all four |
| 0.5.11| Nudge amount | Change to e.g. `25` | Persists (`dm-nudge-amount`); Shift+Arrow on a px field now steps by 25 (default `10`); invalid / ≤0 reverts to the last valid value |
| 0.5.12| Page cursor | Toggle Off with the panel open, then On again | Page cursor swaps **live** (no reload): app-icon cursor (default, On) ↔ plain crosshair; `move` over a selected element stays either way; closing the panel restores the normal cursor |
| 0.5.13| Launch surface (Chrome) | Settings → Launch → Side panel / Floating / Pin on top | Preference persists as `dm-launch-surface`. Side panel: toolbar click opens the docked panel. Floating: toolbar / Alt+D opens a pop-out window. Pin on top: toolbar / Alt+D opens a floating opener with a focused **Pin on top** button (PiP cannot auto-open). Reset restores Side panel |
| 0.5.14| Native select menus stay readable | Dark theme (or OS dark) → open any Design-tab / Tokens `<select>` (including size-mode and detected-replace) | Closed control and the native dropdown list are readable — light text on a dark popup, not black-on-black. Keyboard / AT still use the native `<select>` |

---

## Phase 0.6 — Header overlay panels (Help, Contribute)

The header icons between the MCP chip and the gear open full-page overlays.
All four overlays (MCP, Settings, Help, Contribute) are mutually exclusive — opening
any one closes the other three.

| #     | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 0.6.1 | Open / close Help | Click `?` icon → click `?` again | Help overlay replaces the tabs; second click closes |
| 0.6.2 | Help links | From Help, click Report an issue / Read the docs / Privacy / Security disclosure | Each opens the right page in a new tab via `target="_blank"` |
| 0.6.3 | Copy diagnostics | In Help, click Copy diagnostics | Clipboard contains `Design Mode: x.y.z` + Chrome + Platform + Theme; button label flashes "Copied ✓" then reverts after ~1.5s |
| 0.6.4 | Open / close Contribute | Click heart-handshake icon → click again | Contribute overlay replaces the tabs; second click closes |
| 0.6.5 | Contribute links | Click each row in Contribute (Star repo, Review, Report issue, Start a discussion, Open a pull request, Sponsor on GitHub) | Each opens the right URL in a new tab. The Review row is browser-aware: "Review on the Chrome Web Store" (CWS listing) on Chromium; "Review on Firefox Add-ons" (AMO listing `design-mode-add-on`) on Firefox |
| 0.6.6 | Copy share text | In Contribute, click "Share with your network" | Clipboard contains the prefilled share blurb; browser-aware store link — CWS on Chromium, AMO on Firefox; label flashes "Copied ✓ — paste anywhere" then reverts |
| 0.6.7 | Mutual exclusivity | Open any one of MCP / Settings / Help / Contribute, then click another header icon | Previous overlay closes, new one opens |

---

## Phase 0.7 — MCP page

Opened by clicking the **MCP chip** in the side-panel header (top-right, the dot + "MCP" label).
Replaces the old "MCP" section inside Settings. All values persist via `chrome.storage.local`.

| #     | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 0.7.1 | Chip opens the page | Click the MCP chip | The full-panel MCP page opens (replaces the tabs); the chip's trailing icon is a chevron (not a refresh arrow) |
| 0.7.2 | Auto-refresh on open | Click the chip and watch the status card | Opening the page re-pings the server; the status card's dot + label (Offline / Running / Connected) reflect the live state |
| 0.7.3 | Refresh status button | On the MCP page, click **Refresh status** | Re-pings the content script + server; a toast appears only when the state actually changed |
| 0.7.4 | Back button | Click the ‹ back chevron | Returns to the previously active tab |
| 0.7.5 | MCP — mode (Cloud / Local / Self-hosted) | Switch each | Cloud (default for fresh installs) uses `https://mcp.designmode.app` (or the configured URL); Local uses `ws://localhost:<port>`; Self-hosted exposes a URL field |
| 0.7.6 | MCP — port (Local) | In Local mode, change to e.g. `9970` | Persists; affects the WebSocket URL the extension dials on next connect |
| 0.7.7 | MCP — auto-connect (Local) | Toggle off | Side panel doesn't auto-dial on open; the indicator stays grey until manually connected |
| 0.7.8 | MCP — cloud token & tenant | Register / enter a token + tenant ID | Stored in `chrome.storage.local`; shown masked; Copy MCP config / Copy token / Revoke work; clearing re-disconnects |
| 0.7.9 | Agent setup card | Scroll to "Set up your agent" | The `/design-mode` command rows (Claude Code, Cursor, …) each Copy the command to the clipboard |
| 0.7.10| Chip toggles closed | With the MCP page open, click the chip again | The page closes and returns to the previous tab |
| 0.6.8 | Theme parity | Toggle theme while each overlay is open | Colours follow `--dm-*` custom properties; no flash, no broken contrast |

---

## Phase 0.10 — Keyboard shortcuts

Defaults live in `packages/shared/src/constants.ts:DEFAULT_SHORTCUTS`. Wired actions register
through `registerShortcut(action, handler)` in `packages/extension/src/content/index.ts`.
Shortcuts are suppressed while typing in `<input>` / `<textarea>` / `contenteditable` (except
`Escape`).

Editor shortcuts work with webpage or side-panel focus, outside editable controls;
the address bar and DevTools do not forward them. Only manifest commands belong in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`; Chrome's
limit on suggested command bindings does not apply to in-page handlers.

| #      | Test | Steps | Expected |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| 0.10.0 | Shortcuts popover | Help (`?`) → **Keyboard shortcuts** | A popover card opens listing every shortcut grouped by category (General / Annotations / Animation / Editing / Export / Navigation), keys as `<kbd>` chips. Backdrop click, ✕, and `Esc` each close it; clicking inside the card does not |
| 0.10.1 | Alt+I — Toggle inspect | Press | Inspect crosshair toggles on/off |
| 0.10.1a | macOS Option shortcuts | On macOS, press Option+I/C/R/P/X and Option+1/2/3 with page focus | Each action fires even when macOS produces an alternate glyph or dead key; extra modifiers do not trigger unrelated bindings |
| 0.10.1b | Inspect button without selection | Enable Design Mode with no selection; toggle Inspect off/on, then repeat with a selection | Button stays available, exposes pressed state, and controls only inspection; edits and Design Mode remain active |
| 0.10.1c | Saved Option binding | With a saved custom Alt+letter binding in `dm-shortcuts`, reload and use it on the page | Logical-letter bindings remain usable when macOS emits an alternate glyph; an optional physical code preserves normalised bindings |
| 0.10.1d | Keyboard layout and composition | Use a non-QWERTY layout; exercise logical-letter shortcuts, AltGr text entry and IME composition | Logical-letter shortcuts remain usable; AltGr/IME text entry is not intercepted |
| 0.10.1e | Incomplete saved shortcuts | In a disposable test profile, try empty, partial and malformed `dm-shortcuts` values, then reload or update storage live | Default actions remain available; valid custom bindings are preserved; invalid entries do not disable other shortcuts |
| 0.10.1f | Side-panel shortcut focus | Focus a non-editable panel area, then use Option+I/C/R/P/X and Option+1/2/3; repeat in a panel text field | Editor shortcuts reach the pinned page; text fields retain normal typing behaviour |
| 0.10.2 | Alt+C — Comment on selected element | Select an element → press | Side panel switches to comment-add mode with the textarea focused; if nothing is selected, no-op |
| 0.10.2b | Alt+R — Comment on a region | Press | Crosshair draw mode activates; drag a rectangle → side panel opens the comment composer in "region" mode; Esc mid-draw cancels |
| 0.10.3 | Alt+P — Pause motion | Press | Toggles a global freeze: CSS animations + transitions + Web-Animations API instances + `<video>` elements pause; press again to resume |
| 0.10.4 | Alt+S — Screenshot | Check `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`, assigning `Alt+S` if Chrome left the manifest suggestion blank; select an element or leave on Page → press | Same as the camera button: viewport vs element from selection, destination from Settings → Capture mode (clipboard / download / both) |
| 0.10.5 | Alt+X — Export CSS | Make any change → press | Generated CSS block copied to clipboard |
| 0.10.6 | Esc — Deselect back to hover | Select an element, press Esc | Selection + resize handles clear and the page returns to **hover mode** (hovering still highlights; inspection stays ON — Esc does NOT turn inspect off). Panel Design tab drops to the page/hover view. With a multi-selection active, the first Esc clears the whole set. |
| 0.10.7 | Delete — Remove selected element | Select element → press | Element removed; "delete" entry in Changes tab |
| 0.10.8 | Ctrl/⌘+Z, Ctrl/⌘+⇧+Z — Undo/Redo | Make change → undo → redo | Style/text/DOM/visibility all reversible; works from anywhere except a focused input |
| 0.10.9 | Alt+1 — Layers tab | Press Alt+1 from anywhere on the page (no input focused) | Side panel jumps to Layers tab; that tab's saved scroll position is restored |
| 0.10.10 | Alt+2 — Design tab | Press Alt+2 | Side panel jumps to Design tab; saved scroll restored |
| 0.10.11 | Alt+3 — Changes tab | Press Alt+3 | Side panel jumps to Changes tab; saved scroll restored |
| 0.10.12 | Shortcut suppression in inputs | Focus a page `<input>` / `<textarea>` / contenteditable, then press Alt+1/2/3 (or any other shortcut except Escape) | The page input receives the keystroke as normal; the side-panel action does NOT fire |
| 0.10.13 | Cmd/Ctrl+click on a Layers row | In Layers tab, Cmd-click 3 layer rows in turn | Each toggles into the multi-select set; the "N selected" chip in the action row updates; page-side overlay outlines all 3 |
| 0.10.14 | Shift+click on a Layers row (range) | Click layer A with no modifier → Shift+click layer C three rows down | All visible rows from A to C are selected; the multi-select badge reflects the count |
| 0.10.14b | Delete a Layers multi-selection | Shift-select several sibling layers, click Delete in the action row, inspect Changes, then Undo/Redo each deletion | Every selected layer is deleted and receives one correctly targeted DOM change; the multi-selection clears; Undo/Redo restores/removes the layers in structural order without duplicates |
| 0.10.15 | Arrow Up/Down in Layers | Switch to Layers tab → press ↓ several times | Selection moves down one visible row per press, wraps at the end; the row stays in view (`scrollIntoView` keeps it visible) |
| 0.10.16 | Enter to collapse/expand a container row | In Layers tab, select a container row with children → Enter | Children collapse; press Enter again → re-expand |
| 0.10.17 | Numeric Arrow stepping (px props) | Click any pixel input (e.g. font-size) → ↑ | Value increments by 1; Shift+↑ by the Settings → Nudge amount (default 10) |
| 0.10.18 | Numeric Arrow stepping (unitless props) | Click a unitless input (e.g. line-height) → ↑ | Value increments by 0.1; Shift+↑ by 1 |
| 0.10.19 | Esc priority | With a multi-selection active, press Esc twice | First press clears the multi-selection; second clears the single selection back to hover. Esc never turns inspection off. |
| 0.10.20 | Esc with panel focused | Select an element, click into the side panel (panel has focus), press Esc | The page selection + resize handles clear and the Design tab drops to the page/hover view (the panel forwards a deselect to the page). |
| 0.10.21 | Multi-select plain-click collapse | Multi-select 3 elements, then plain-click (no Shift) a 4th element | The whole set clears and **only the 4th** is selected (Figma parity); Shift-click still adds/toggles set membership. |
| 0.10.22 | Undo rich-text keeps formatting, no tags | Bold a word in the rich-text editor, save, then Ctrl/⌘+Z, then redo | Text restores as **formatted text** — no literal `<b>`/`<tags>` appear as visible characters; the Changes row appears/disappears in sync. |
| 0.10.23 | Undo steps back one edit | Set font-size 16→20, then 20→28 on one element, then Ctrl/⌘+Z | First undo returns to **20** (not straight to 16); a second undo returns to 16 and the Changes row clears. Resize-width-only and move also actually revert on undo. |
| 0.10.23b | Tabs work after early panel-open (no duplicate injection) | On a slow/SPA page (e.g. designmode.app), open the side panel while the page is still loading, then click **Layers** and **Changes** | Both tabs switch and populate (DOM tree / change list); the page console shows the "Content script loaded" line **once** per document load, not repeated |
| 0.10.24 | Ctrl/⌘+Enter on comment textarea | Focus a comment textarea → Ctrl/⌘+Enter | Comment submits |
| 0.10.25 | Enter on colour-picker hex input | Type a hex value (e.g. `#abc123`) in the picker → Enter | Value applied; picker dropdown closes |

---

## Phase 1 — Inspect & select

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 1.1  | Hover highlight | Move mouse over page elements | Configurable hover overlay (default blue) tracks the hovered element with rounded corners |
| 1.2  | Click to select | Click any element | Configurable selection overlay (default orange) with `W × H` dimension label |
| 1.3  | Selected state in header | After click | Design tab indicator shows **Selected** (blue badge) — never **Hovering** |
| 1.4  | Hover→Click race fix | Hover an element ~80ms then click it | Indicator goes straight to **Selected**; never flips back to **Hovering** |
| 1.5  | Breadcrumbs | Select a deeply-nested element | Breadcrumb path shown (e.g. `body › main › section.hero › h1`) |
| 1.6  | Comment pins not selectable | Hover/click a yellow pin | Pin is NOT highlighted by the inspector |
| 1.7  | DM overlays not selectable | Hover the hover/select overlay | Overlay is transparent to the mouse (passes through) |
| 1.8  | Selection follows scroll | Select an element then scroll | Select overlay stays anchored to the element |
| 1.9  | Escape deselects | Press `Escape` with a selection | Selection cleared, design tab returns to page-context view |
| 1.10 | Parent / child traversal | Click ↑ then ↓ in the action row | Selection moves to parent, then back to first child |
| 1.11 | Axis guides on hover | Hover any element | Blue dashed lines run through the element's four edges, spanning the full document; clear on mouse-out |
| 1.12 | Hover distance pills | Select an element, then hover a stacked sibling | Vertical gap pill PLUS the left/right side-edge offset pills with dashed extension lines (e.g. `20` gap + `40`/`52` side offsets); containment → 4 inset gaps |
| 1.13 | Eight resize handles | Select an element | Eight orange dots — four corners + four edge midpoints — on the selection box, each with the correct resize cursor |
| 1.14 | Drag-resize is live + guided | Drag any handle | Element resizes live; the orange outline + `W × H` label track instantly (no lag); side-panel W/H fields update during the drag; orange axis guides show for alignment |
| 1.15 | Resize persists + exports | Release the drag, open Changes tab + Export CSS | Changed `width`/`height` appear as a `Resize` row in Changes and in the exported CSS; Cmd/Ctrl+Z reverts. Edge handles commit only the one dimension they changed |
| 1.16 | Resize follows scroll | Resize, then scroll | All eight handles stay anchored to the element |
| 1.17 | Shift-select pairwise distances | Select an element, then Shift+click a second | Both outline (dashed); pairwise distance pills render between them; Shift+click more to extend |
| 1.18 | Pairwise distances persist on hover/scroll | With ≥2 shift-selected, move the mouse away and scroll | Pairwise pills remain and stay anchored (not cleared by mouse-out) |
| 1.19 | Move cursor over selection | Select an element, then hover its body (not a handle) | Cursor swaps to `move`; cursor returns to crosshair when hovering any non-selected element |
| 1.20 | Drag-to-move is live + guided | Select a non-static element, drag its body | Element moves live; orange outline + handles follow the cursor; Design-tab **X** / **Y** fields tick during the drag; magenta alignment guides appear when edges/centres line up with siblings (see 1.28) |
| 1.21 | Move persists + exports | Release the drag, open Changes tab + Export CSS | New `left`/`top` appear as a single **Move** group in Changes and in the exported CSS; Cmd/Ctrl+Z reverts both offsets together |
| 1.22 | Move under-threshold = click | Mousedown on the selected element, release without moving | No drag fires; no Changes entry; selection stays as-is |
| 1.23 | Shift-axis lock | Drag the selected element with **Shift** held | Motion locks to the dominant axis (purely horizontal or purely vertical) |
| 1.24 | Static-promote on first drag | Pick a `position: static` element (e.g. an in-flow heading), drag its body | Element moves; Design tab's Position field becomes `relative`; X/Y inputs appear with the drag delta; Changes shows the **Move** group with three entries (`position`, `left`, `top`); a single undo reverts all three |
| 1.25 | Multi-select drag in lockstep | Shift-click two elements, then drag either one | Both elements translate by the same delta; one undo reverts the whole gesture |
| 1.26 | Move follows scroll | Move an element, then scroll the page | The selection box + handles stay anchored to the element |
| 1.27 | Margin/padding overlay bands | Hover or select an element with non-zero margin **and** padding | Light-red margin band paints outside the element box; light-green padding band paints between border and content; bands hide when the spacing is all-zero; colours follow Settings → Inspector overlay |
| 1.28 | Alignment guides + snap on move | Select an element in a container with siblings, drag it so an edge/centre nears a sibling's edge/centre (or the parent's) | A **solid magenta** guide appears through the match and the element **snaps** onto that line; releasing commits the snapped `left`/`top`. Hold **Alt** while dragging → no snap, no guides (free move). Shift-axis-lock still applies (only the free axis snaps). Multi-select drag snaps as a group. Guides clear on drop |
| 1.29 | Hover-off guide in touch/responsive mode | Turn on the browser's device toolbar with touch emulation (Chrome: device type **Mobile** — the default in Responsive; Firefox: touch simulation on) so the tab reports `(hover: none)` | The panel replaces its tabs with a full-panel **"Hover is off in responsive mode"** guide with short **bulleted** browser-aware steps (Chrome: ⋮ → Add device type → set **Desktop** or **Mobile (no touch)**, width doesn't matter; Firefox: click the **touch simulation** toggle off) + a "returns to normal on its own" note and a **Continue anyway** button |
| 1.30 | Continue anyway keeps all tabs | On the 1.29 guide, click **Continue anyway** | The guide dismisses to the normal UI with **all three tabs (Layers/Design/Changes)** present; tapping an element selects it and edits/record normally |
| 1.31 | Re-show + auto-restore | From 1.30, set device **type** to Desktop (hover returns) → then back to Mobile/touch | When hover returns the panel restores normal on its own (no reload); switching touch back on **re-shows** the guide |

---

## Phase 2 — Design tab: Typography & rich text

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 2.1  | Rich-text editor — leaf text | Select a `<p>` / `<h1>` with no element children | "Text Content" contenteditable shows the element's HTML; B / I / U / S / list / link toolbar above it |
| 2.1a | Rich-text editor — text layer with children | Select a layer that shows the T (type) icon in Layers (h1-h6, p, span, a, button, li, etc.) | Editor still renders, seeded with the element's `innerHTML` |
| 2.2  | No editor for non-text containers | Select a generic `<div>` / `<section>` (icon is layoutGrid / layoutDashboard, not T) | No "Text Content" field |
| 2.3  | Toolbar Bold / Italic / Underline / Strike | Select text in editor → click each | Formatting wraps the selection (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>`); applies to the live page on blur |
| 2.4  | Toolbar lists | Click bulleted / numbered list | `<ul>` / `<ol>` inserted into editor; markers visible (CSS in `index.html` keeps them shown) |
| 2.5  | Toolbar link | Select text → click link → enter URL | Wraps selection in `<a href="…">`; renders in accent colour with underline |
| 2.6  | Toolbar Strip formatting | Select text → click `⨯ fmt` | All inline formatting removed |
| 2.7  | Save on blur | Edit text → click outside the editor | Element updates; **text-change row appears in Changes tab** with `isHtml: true` so the HTML round-trips on reload |
| 2.8  | Native shortcuts | While editing, press `⌘B` / `⌘I` / `⌘U` | Browser's contenteditable shortcuts work (B/I/U toggle selection) |
| 2.8a | Enter commits and leaves the field | Edit a single-line value or Text Content, then press Enter/Return | The value is applied and keyboard focus leaves the field; Shift+Enter still inserts a newline in multiline fields |
| 2.8b | Mixed text and media preservation | In `test-fixtures/index.html`, select `#class-icon-btn`, `#svg-icon-btn`, and `#css-media-btn`; confirm the inert media chip is visible, edit only their text, and press Enter, then Undo and Redo | Enter commits and leaves the editor; text updates normally; the empty class icon, attributed SVG wrapper, and nested CSS-image span remain in their original position with their original attributes, without duplication through edit/Undo/Redo, and no page markup executes in the panel |
| 2.8c | Nested text-layer preservation | Select `#nested-text-layer`, replace the parent's editable text, then select its `.bg-primary` child and edit that child directly | The attributed child appears as an inert chip while its parent is edited and survives unchanged; selecting the child exposes its own text for editing |
| 2.8d | Link destination editing | Select `#rich-link`, change the URL in the Markdown-style `[label](URL)` row, then try `javascript:alert(1)` | The safe URL updates the link and its Changes entry without exposing the hidden accessibility span or SVG; the active-protocol URL is rejected |
| 2.9  | Font weight named dropdown | Click weight | Options shown as `Thin (100)`, `Light (300)`, `Regular (400)`, `Medium (500)`, `Semi Bold (600)`, `Bold (700)`, etc. |
| 2.10 | Strict numeric inputs | Type `abc` in font size | Characters are blocked; only digits / single minus / one decimal up to 2 places allowed |
| 2.11 | Arrow stepping | Click size, press ↑ | Increments by 1 (px appended automatically) |
| 2.12 | Shift + arrow stepping | `Shift+↑` | Increments by 10 |
| 2.13 | Bold / italic / underline / strike toggles in Typography section | Click each B / I / U / S below the rich text editor | Toggles apply visually; toggle again to remove |
| 2.14 | Color picker — compact solid default | Click any colour swatch | Picker opens **compact**: a live swatch, a focused Hex field, the eyedropper (Chrome), the HEX/RGB/HSL format cycle, a **Custom colour** disclosure (collapsed), and the Site Colors list below. The big HSV square + hue slider are **not** shown until Custom is expanded |
| 2.14b | Color picker — Custom colour disclosure | In an open picker, click **Custom colour** | The HSV square + hue slider + numeric channels (R/G/B, or H/S/L per Settings → Color Format) expand below; the chevron flips; clicking again collapses them. Re-opening the picker starts collapsed again |
| 2.15 | Color picker — eyedropper | Click the eyedropper (pen) icon with a Chrome 95+ browser | EyeDropper API engages; pick a colour from anywhere on screen → applied |
| 2.16 | Color token dropdown | Click the swatch button → click any token row | `var(--token)` is set on the property; row appears in Changes tab |
| 2.17 | Color token search | With dropdown open, type "primary" | Token list filters to only `--*primary*` rows |
| 2.18 | Custom hex via Enter | Type `#abc123` and press Enter in the hex input | `#abc123` applied as the colour |
| 2.19 | Click outside closes dropdown | Click anywhere outside | Dropdown closes |
| 2.20 | Format cycle button | With colour dropdown open, click the format button | Cycles HEX → RGB → HSL; Settings → Color Format also reflects |
| 2.21 | HEX vs RGBA format | Settings → Color Format → HEX | All colour text inputs render `#xxxxxx`; switch to RGBA → `rgba(...)` |
| 2.22 | Text alignment / transform / decoration | Change each control | Element updates instantly |
| 2.23 | Contrast checker — ratio | Open the colour picker on a text colour over a known background | A contrast row at the top of the picker (above the essentials row) shows the ratio vs the effective background (e.g. `4.5:1`) with a diagonal-split chip |
| 2.24 | Contrast checker — rating + AA/AAA | Read the contrast row | Absolute rating pill (Excellent / Good / Poor / Very Poor) plus AA and AAA tabs showing both pass/fail verdicts at once |
| 2.25 | Contrast checker — category override | Open the Category popover, switch Auto → Large → Normal → Graphics | The pass/fail verdict updates to the chosen threshold; the choice + AA/AAA level persist across reloads |
| 2.26 | Contrast checker — failing foreground | Open the colour picker on text whose contrast fails AA | Ratio, absolute rating, and AA/AAA verdicts remain visible; no automatic replacement-colour action is shown |
| 2.27 | Page CSS states — inspect + force | Select an element with a real `:hover` rule in a same-origin stylesheet | Hover chip shows a rule count. Clicking Hover applies `.dm-force-hover` (existing FORCE_STATE) and the inspected page hover declarations without adding application hover classes during inspect. `:visited` never appears. Deselect or disable clears the forced class |

## Phase 3 — Design tab: spacing, layout, border, effects

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 3.0  | Empty sections default collapsed | Select a plain `<div>` with a background but no border/shadow/filter | **Stroke**, **Effects**, and **Layout guide** open collapsed (nothing to show); **Fill** opens expanded (it has a background). Select an element that *does* have a border/shadow and those sections open expanded. Manually toggling a section pins it (overrides the content default) until the next selection of an untoggled section |
| 3.1  | Computed box layout | Select an element with margin and padding → expand Layout → Advanced | Chrome-DevTools box shown: outer dashed (margin) → inner solid (padding) → centre dimension pill (`W × H`) |
| 3.2  | Edit padding via computed box | In Layout → Advanced, click padding-top in the box, type `24`, blur | Element padding-top becomes `24px`; change recorded |
| 3.2a | Figma margin/padding expand | In Layout, type a uniform Margin value; click the expand (scan) button on the Margin row | Uniform writes the `margin` shorthand; expand reveals 4 side inputs (↑→↓←) writing `margin-top/right/bottom/left`; per-side edits land in Changes. Same for Padding |
| 3.3  | Border width 4 sides | Set top / right / bottom / left widths | All 4 borders update independently |
| 3.4  | Border link button | Click the round link icon in the centre of the 2×2 grid | Icon turns blue (linked); editing one side updates all four |
| 3.5  | Border unlink | Click again | Icon reverts to grey outline; edits are independent |
| 3.6  | Radius linkable | Same flow with the radius grid | All four corners can be linked / unlinked |
| 3.7  | Stroke position (Inside / Outside / Center) | Change in Stroke section | Inside renders via inset box-shadow chain; Outside via `border-*` (single) or outer box-shadow (multi); Center via `outline-*` |
| 3.8  | Display flex sub-controls | Set display to flex | Flex direction / wrap / justify / align / gap controls appear |
| 3.9  | Display grid sub-controls | Set display to grid | Grid template columns/rows + gap controls appear |
| 3.9a | Gap Fixed / Auto mode | On a flex/grid container, Col/Row gap shows a Fixed/Auto dropdown. Type a px value in Fixed; switch to Auto | Fixed writes `column-gap`/`row-gap`; Auto spreads children via `space-between` (justify-content, or align-content for grid rows), field goes read-only showing the measured gap; switching back to Fixed restores an editable px value. Container whose CSS already has `space-between` opens in Auto |
| 3.9b | Gap Auto preserves 9-pad alignment | Set a Children-align 9-pad position (e.g. center), switch gap to Auto, then back to Fixed | While Auto is active no 9-pad dot is falsely highlighted; switching back to Fixed restores the previously chosen alignment instead of resetting it |
| 3.10 | Position offsets | Set position to `relative`, top `10` | Element shifts down 10px |
| 3.11 | Z-index strict numeric | Type `10.5` in z-index | Allowed (2 decimals); type letters → blocked |
| 3.12 | Opacity / transform | Set `opacity: 0.5`, transform `rotate(3deg)` | Both apply visually |
| 3.13 | Box shadow builder | Use shadow inputs | Shadow appears; values reflect in Changes tab |
| 3.14 | Animation easing visualizer | In Motion → Advanced, edit a `transition` value, click the curve preview icon | Bézier panel opens with adjustable control points; spring mode toggles to stiffness / damping / mass sliders |
| 3.15 | Motion: add Hover interaction | Motion section → **When:** → **Hover** | A Hover card appears seeded with a Fade change + shared Curve; hovering the element on the page fades it |
| 3.16 | Motion: real preview | On the Hover card, click ▶ Preview | Element plays the transition (forced `.dm-force-hover`); button toggles to pause; click again to stop |
| 3.17 | Motion: add change preset | On a Hover card, click the **Lift** chip | A `translate` change row is added; hovering lifts the element |
| 3.18 | Motion: Appear (@starting-style) | **When:** → **Appear**, then click ▶ | Element re-mounts and animates in from the seeded start state |
| 3.19 | Motion: Loop | **When:** → **Loop**, pick `dm-pulse` | Element pulses continuously; ▶ restarts the animation |
| 3.20 | Motion: Scroll | **When:** → **Scroll** | `animation-timeline: view()` seeded; scrolling the element through the viewport drives the animation |
| 3.21 | Motion: variant export | Add a Hover interaction, open Copy CSS | Output has a base rule + a real `.selector:hover { … }` rule (SCSS same; Tailwind uses `hover:`) |
| 3.22 | Motion: Advanced disclosure | Toggle the Motion **sliders** icon | Raw Transition / Animation / Transform / Motion-path / View-transition / Scroll-driven editors appear below the cards |
| 3.23 | Appearance: icon-first fields | Select an element → expand Appearance | Opacity field is led by a blend icon (no visible "Opacity" label — name shows on hover); Corner radius field is led by a maximize icon (no visible "Corner radius" label). Blend mode and Isolation are not in the main row — open Appearance → Advanced to find them |
| 3.23a | Appearance: Corner shape | Select an element with a non-zero border-radius → in the Opacity/Corner-radius row, click the **corner-shape icon** (between the radius field and the `scan` expand icon) → pick `squircle` (or bevel/scoop/notch) | A single inline row of six shape icons expands below the row (icon-coloured, name on hover), round highlighted by default, not clipped by the next section; picking one applies `corner-shape` and closes the row. On newest Chromium the corners reshape live; the change appears in the Changes tab under Appearance and in Export CSS. Reselecting shows the trigger reflecting the set shape. Clicking outside also closes the row. On browsers without support the property is recorded but has no visual effect |
| 3.24 | Corner radius: Mixed → forced uniform | Click the corner-expand (`scan`) toggle, set each of the 4 corners to a different value, collapse back to the primary row, then type a number into the primary field (showing `Mixed`) | Collapsed primary field shows a `Mixed` placeholder before the edit; typing over it writes the `border-radius` shorthand and all four corners snap to the typed value — re-expanding shows all 4 corners equal |
| 3.25 | Layout guide: section eye visibility gating | Add one layout guide to an element, then add a second | With one guide, no section-level eye appears next to the Layout guide header — only the row's own eye. Once 2+ guides exist, a section eye appears top-right of the section header |
| 3.26 | Layout guide: parent/child hide | With 2+ guides on an element, click the section eye to hide all guides, then click one dimmed row's own eye | Every guide disappears from the page; each row's own eye dims (~40% opacity) but still reflects and can toggle its individual on/off state; re-enabling the section eye reveals only the rows currently marked visible |
| 3.27 | Layout guide: compact color panel | On a layout guide's expanded row, click the Colour swatch | The color panel opens with the essentials row (swatch + hex + eyedropper + format) and the HSV picker inline (compact mode keeps Custom expanded — no disclosure toggle) — no WCAG contrast row and no Site Colors token list |
| 3.28 | Computed flex/grid overlay | Select a flex or grid container → click **Show computed layout** | A session-only overlay paints computed tracks / children on the element. It is not a layout guide and does not appear in Changes. Toggle off, deselect, or disable Design Mode removes it |
| 3.29 | Object alignment — block parent | Select a block-flow child (parent `display: block`) | The three horizontal alignment buttons are enabled; the three vertical ones are **disabled** with a tooltip explaining they need a flex/grid parent or a positioned layer. Select a flex/grid child or an `absolute` layer → all six are enabled again |
| 3.30 | Distribute auto-flexes the parent | Multi-select 2+ siblings whose parent is `display: block` → Position → **Distribute horizontally** | Parent gets `display: flex` + `justify-content: space-between`; the siblings visibly spread across the parent's width. Changes shows ONE `Distribute` group holding those writes, and the group's trash reverts them in one click. On an already-flex parent only the axis property that actually changes is written (no no-op `display: flex` row). On a grid parent no `display` / `flex-direction` is written at all — the axis property alone |

---

## Phase 4 — Design tab: media

| #   | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-----|------|-------|----------|
| 4.1 | Image preview | Select an `<img>` | Media section shows preview thumbnail + dimensions + transferred file size (e.g. `124 KB`) + "Download {filename}" button |
| 4.2 | Image download | Click Download | Browser downloads the original image with its filename; the button briefly shows a check + "Downloaded" (~1.2s) then restores |
| 4.3 | SVG inline | Select an inline `<svg>` | Media section shows rendered SVG, "Download icon.svg" + "Copy SVG markup" |
| 4.4 | Copy SVG markup | Click "Copy SVG markup" | SVG `outerHTML` ends up in the clipboard (paste into a text file to verify); the button briefly shows a check + "Copied" (~1.2s) then restores |
| 4.5 | Video element | Select a `<video>` | Embedded `<video>` controls + Download button |
| 4.6 | Background image | Select a div with `background-image: url(...)` | Media section detects the URL, offers download |
| 4.7 | Icon library detection | Select a Lucide / Heroicons / Remix icon | Icon section appears showing library + name only; no package/CDN is loaded and no replacement control appears |
| 4.8 | Media file size — cross-origin | Select a cross-origin image whose response is opaque | Meta line shows resolution + kind but omits the size (no error) |

---

## Phase 5 — Layers tab

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 5.1  | DOM tree loads | Switch to Layers | Indented tree of every visible element |
| 5.2  | Search | Type `button` in the search field | Tree filters to layers with `button` in tag or display name; ancestors expand to show matches |
| 5.3  | Filter — All / Visible / Hidden / Modified | Click each chip | All shows everything; Visible hides deleted/hidden; Hidden shows only `display: none` elements; Modified shows only elements with tracked changes |
| 5.4  | Layer click | Click a layer row | Element selected on the page, Design tab populates |
| 5.5  | Layer hover | Hover a row | Hover overlay appears on the corresponding page element |
| 5.6  | Drag to reorder | Drag a row over a sibling | Source DOM updates; "move" entry appears in Changes tab |
| 5.7  | Visibility toggle | Click the eye icon on a row | Element becomes `display: none`; row dims; eye icon flips to eyeOff |
| 5.8  | Trash icon | Click the trash icon | Element removed; "delete" entry appears in Changes tab |
| 5.9  | Duplicate marker | Duplicate an element | Layers row of the duplicate carries the `dm-clone` marker class and shows a "(copy)" suffix label |
| 5.10 | DM elements excluded | Inspect the tree | No `dm-hover`, `dm-select`, `dm-comment-pin`, or `dm-applied-styles` rows |
| 5.11 | Horizontal pan on deep trees | On a deeply nested page (10+ levels), scroll the tree horizontally | Full layer names become visible while panning; search/filter header stays pinned top-left; the crosshair/eye hover actions stay pinned at the right edge of every hovered row; panned position survives re-renders (e.g. hovering rows) |

---

## Phase 6 — Comments

| #   | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-----|------|-------|----------|
| 6.1 | Add a comment | Select element → comment icon → type → Add | Yellow pin appears on the element; comment row in Changes tab |
| 6.2 | Add via Alt+C | Select element → press `Alt+C` | Comment textarea appears focused (same as clicking the comment icon) |
| 6.3 | Pin position | Add a comment | Pin sits at the top-right of the element |
| 6.4 | Pin click | Click the pin on the page | Side panel switches to Changes tab and opens the comment for editing |
| 6.5 | Edit / delete | Edit text and Save / Delete | Updates / removes the comment + pin |
| 6.6 | Mark as resolved | Click the resolved toggle on a comment row | `resolved: true` set; row moves under the Resolved sub-filter (Phase 7) |
| 6.7 | Persistence | Reload page | Comment + pin re-appear (resolved state preserved) |
| 6.8 | Pin not inspectable | Hover a pin in inspect mode | Pin is transparent to the inspector |
| 6.9 | Region comment — drop (drag) | Click the dashed-square button (or `Alt+R`) → drag a box over empty page space | Dashed yellow box stays on the page; composer opens in "region" mode. The box persists while you type |
| 6.9b | Region comment — drop (click) | Region mode → single click on the canvas (no drag) | A default-sized (~180×110) yellow box drops at the click point and stays; composer opens — no DOM element needs selecting |
| 6.9c | Region comment — box persists then commits | With the pending box showing, type → Add | The pending box is replaced by the committed region box + numbered pin; comment row shows a region badge |
| 6.10 | Region comment — scroll/persist | Drop a box, scroll the page (while composing and after Add), then reload | The box (pending and committed) stays anchored to the document position; committed box + pin survive reload |
| 6.11 | Region comment — cancel removes box | Drop a box → click Cancel in the composer | The pending yellow box disappears; no comment created. (Pressing `Esc` mid-drag, before release, also exits with no box) |
| 6.12 | Inspect suspended while composing | Turn Inspect on → select an element → open the comment composer (add), then hover/click other elements on the page | Inspect is off while the composer is open (no hover outlines, clicks don't reselect); on Add/Cancel inspect returns to its prior on state. Same for **editing** a comment and for **region** compose |
| 6.13 | Inspect stays off if it was off | With Inspect off, open a composer then close it | Inspect remains off throughout (prior state restored, not force-enabled) |

---

## Phase 7 — Changes tab

| #     | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 7.1   | Empty state | No changes yet | Sparkles icon + "No changes yet" message |
| 7.2   | Filter chips | Click All / Style / Text / DOM / Comment | Each chip filters the list to just that category; counts appear next to each chip |
| 7.3   | Comment sub-filter | While Comment chip active | Open / Resolved / All sub-chips appear, with their own counts |
| 7.4   | Search | Type a property name (e.g. `padding`) in the search bar | List filters by free-text match across selector, property, value, and comment text |
| 7.5   | Sort | Click the sort icon → pick Oldest / Newest / By element | Order updates accordingly |
| 7.6   | Bulk select | Tick the checkboxes on 3 rows → click "Delete selected" | All 3 changes reverted on the page; counts drop |
| 7.7   | Style change recorded | Edit any CSS property | Row appears with `prop: old → new` and the element selector |
| 7.8   | Text change recorded | Edit text content (rich-text) | Text-change row appears; storing as HTML so reload round-trips formatting |
| 7.8a  | Word-level text diff | Change `Add to Mozilla` to `Add to Chrome` | `Mozilla` is fully red and struck, `Chrome` is fully green, and unchanged `Add to ` stays grey; no shared character inside a replaced word is treated as unchanged |
| 7.9   | DOM change recorded | Duplicate / delete / move / hide | Row appears with the action label |
| 7.10  | No double-record on duplicate | Click Duplicate **once** | Exactly **one** "duplicate" row appears (regression: previously logged twice) |
| 7.11  | Comment recorded | Add a comment | Yellow note row appears with selector |
| 7.12  | Group by element | Make multiple edits to the same `.card` | Changes tab groups them under one selector header with a count |
| 7.13  | Preset group label | Apply a preset to an element | Multiple property changes collapse into one row labelled with the preset name (`groupKind: 'preset'`) |
| 7.14  | Multi-select group label | With multi-select on N elements, edit a property | Single row labelled `multi-select` with count `N elements` |
| 7.15  | Visibility group label | Hide → Show toggling | Single row labelled per-element with `groupKind: 'visibility'` |
| 7.16  | Single revert | Hover a row → click trash | Style/text/DOM change is **actually reversed** on the page (not just removed from the list) |
| 7.17  | Revert duplicate | Trash a duplicate row | The duplicated element is removed from the DOM |
| 7.18  | Revert delete | Trash a delete row | The deleted element is re-inserted from saved outerHTML |
| 7.19  | View Original | Click **View Original** | Page visually reverts to its initial state — styles, text, deleted elements re-appear, duplicates hide, comment pins hide. Banner: "Viewing original — click View Changes to see your edits" |
| 7.20  | View Changes | Click **View Changes** | Edits + duplicated elements + comment pins re-appear |
| 7.21  | Toggle button states | While viewing one mode | Active button is filled accent; inactive button is outline |
| 7.22  | Clear All confirmation | Click **Clear All** | Inline overlay modal "Clear all changes?" with Cancel / Clear; Cancel keeps state |
| 7.23  | Clear All reverts everything | Confirm Clear All | Every style / text / DOM / comment is undone on the page; Changes tab empties; persistence cleared; deleted elements re-inserted; `dm-clone` markers stripped |
| 7.24  | Batch apply (zap) — outline | Edit a property on a recurring class (e.g. `.btn`) | Zap icon next to the row is grey outline by default |
| 7.25  | Batch apply — fill | Click the zap | Icon becomes filled accent; the same change applies to every matching element on the page |
| 7.26  | Batch unflag | Click zap again | Icon returns to outline (does NOT un-apply the changes — that's the trash button's job) |
| 7.27  | Tab badge count | Make 5 changes | "Changes" tab shows badge `5` (style + text + DOM + comments combined) |
| 7.28  | Breakpoint pill on rows | Narrow the browser so the page viewport is < 1024px → edit a style / text / duplicate an element | Each such row shows a small `MOBILE` / `TABLET` pill (next to the status badge); hovering it shows `Edited at {bp} · {width}px`. Desktop-width edits show no pill; the pill survives reload (persisted on the change) |

---

## Phase 8 — Design-system / Tokens panel

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 8.1  | Open Tokens panel | Click the swatch-book icon in the action row | Panel opens with three tabs: **Declared**, **Detected**, **Defined**; last-active tab is restored from `dm-tokens-tab` |
| 8.2  | Declared — grouping | Switch to Declared | Every CSS variable the page declares is listed — not just `:root` — grouped by purpose (Colour / Typography / Spacing / Radius / Shadow / Other), each row with swatch/preview + current value + inline editor |
| 8.3  | Declared — live repaint | Type a new value (e.g. change a colour token's hex) | The page repaints live via the `dm-token-overrides` stylesheet without a reload |
| 8.4  | Declared — reset | Click the reset button on an edited row | Value restores to the original captured on the first edit |
| 8.5  | `×N uses` preview | Click the `×N uses` badge on a token | On-page consumers light up via the multi-select overlay system |
| 8.6  | Detected — histograms | Switch to Detected | Histograms of computed values used by viewport-visible elements for spacing / radius / font-size / shadow, each with a count |
| 8.7  | Detected — drift warning | Find a detected value close to a declared token | Drift warning surfaces on that row |
| 8.8  | Detected — Replace with… | Open the "Replace with…" dropdown → pick a closest token (lower / exact / upper) | `CONSOLIDATE_DETECTED` scan rewrites every matching computed value as `var(--name)`; appears as a **single grouped change** in the Changes tab |
| 8.9  | Defined — empty by default | Open Defined on a fresh install | List is empty; no built-in seeds |
| 8.10 | Defined — save | Select an element, choose a Kind (only kinds with non-default values on this element are listed), name, **Save** | Preset appears in the list under the chosen kind |
| 8.11 | Defined — apply | Click **Apply** on a preset | Styles applied with `groupKind: 'preset'`; rows in Changes tab collapse to a single labelled row; an **↶ Applied** button appears on the preset row |
| 8.12 | Defined — ↶ Applied revert | Click the **↶ Applied** button | Every change in that application's `groupId` reverts |
| 8.13 | Defined — edit | Pencil → editor; rename + tweak values (kind is a locked badge) → save | Updates; invalid CSS dropped silently with a toast |
| 8.14 | Defined — delete | Trash → confirmation overlay → confirm | Removed from list and storage |
| 8.15 | Export / Import | **Export** → file downloads with kind marker `design-mode-design-system`; **Import** the same file | Re-imports cleanly; a foreign JSON (missing the marker) is rejected with a toast |
| 8.16 | Cross-tab filters + search | Click filter chips (All / Colours / Type / Spacing / Radius / Shadow / Other) and type in the search box | Filters and search filter the active tab's rows; semantics adapt per tab |
| 8.17 | "Used on this page" toggle | Toggle on | Active tab filters to entries actually consumed by viewport-visible elements |
| 8.18 | Markdown exporter — Tokens changed | Edit a `:root` var → Copy as Prompt | Output contains a focused **`## Tokens changed`** section listing only edited tokens (original → current). With no root-var edits, the section is omitted |
| 8.18a | Token edits show in Changes tab | Edit a `:root` var → open the Changes tab | A row appears under a `:root` / Design-tokens group showing `--var: original → current`; the **Tokens** filter chip counts it; the row's Revert restores the original; "Clear all" removes it. Parity with the Copy as Prompt's Tokens-changed section |
| 8.19 | Pre-rework presets read back | If you had presets from before this rework | They load into the Defined tab without migration; `groupId` continues to work |

### Phase 8b — Scopes, design systems, token badges

Run on a Carbon site (carbondesignsystem.com) and a shadcn site (ui.shadcn.com).

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 8.20 | Theme-scoped detection | Open the Tokens panel on carbondesignsystem.com | Hundreds of `--cds-*` tokens listed (they're declared on theme classes, not `:root` — the old `:root`-only scan found none) |
| 8.21 | Design-system banner | Same page | An **IBM Carbon** chip shows with a token count; clicking it filters to `--cds-*` tokens. On ui.shadcn.com the chip reads **shadcn/ui** |
| 8.22 | Scope switching | Open the scope dropdown → pick a non-primary theme (e.g. `.cds--g100`) | Rows show *that* scope's values; scopes that match nothing on the page are marked `inactive` |
| 8.23 | Component tokens section | Scroll the Declared tab | Component-scoped tokens (e.g. `.cds--btn { --cds-btn-* }`) sit in their own collapsed **Component tokens** section, not mixed into the semantic groups |
| 8.24 | Scoped edit is contained | Edit a token on a theme scope that applies to only part of the page | Only elements inside that scope repaint; elements themed by a sibling scope are untouched; Reset restores |
| 8.25 | Token badge appears | Select a Carbon button → Design tab | Fields authored from tokens show a ◆ badge (Fill shows the token name); hovering a numeric field's diamond shows the full var name |
| 8.26 | Badge is cascade-accurate | Select an element whose colour comes from a *literal* rule that shadows a `var()` rule with the same value | **No badge** on that field — the literal wins the cascade, so the property isn't token-driven |
| 8.27 | Swap token (non-colour) | Badge → **Swap token…** on a spacing / radius / type field | A group-matched token picker opens; picking one applies `var(--token)`, the page repaints, and the Changes row reads `→ var(--token)` |
| 8.28 | Edit token globally | Badge → **Edit token globally** | Tokens panel opens with that token focused/highlighted **and its scope pre-selected**; editing the value changes the element you started from |
| 8.29 | Detach from token | Badge → **Detach from token** | The resolved literal is written; the badge disappears |
| 8.30 | `var()` in numeric fields | Type `var(--cds-spacing-05)` into a radius or stroke-weight field → Enter | The value is applied verbatim (previously clamped to `0`); Changes shows the `var()` |
| 8.31 | Token change → MCP | Edit a token → call `get_changes` (local and cloud) | Response contains `tokenChanges` with `cssVar`, `scopeSelector`, `oldValue`, `newValue`, `system`, `cssRule`, plus a `tokenGuidance` string |
| 8.32 | Token change → prompt | Edit a theme-scoped token → Copy as Prompt | `## Tokens changed` names the token, its design system, and its scope, followed by the "edit the definition at its source" guidance |
| 8.33 | Refresh picks up a theme switch | Toggle the site's theme → click the panel's refresh (⟳) | Token values re-scan to the now-active theme |
| 8.34 | Token edit on undo stack | Edit a token value → Ctrl/⌘+Z → Ctrl/⌘+⇧+Z | The token reverts to its previous value (Changes row drops if back to original), then re-applies |

---

## Phase 9 — Action row & advanced selection

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 9.1  | Parent / child / duplicate / delete / comment / screenshot / multi-select | Each button in the action row | All work as labelled |
| 9.2  | Disable when no selection | Deselect | Parent, child, duplicate, delete, comment, multi-select dim out; screenshot stays enabled |
| 9.3  | Screenshot — viewport | No selection (and no hover) → click camera | Full viewport PNG copied to clipboard (or downloaded, depending on Settings → Screenshot mode) |
| 9.4  | Screenshot — element only | **Select** an element → click camera | PNG copied to clipboard contains **only that element** (cropped from viewport, not the surrounding page) |
| 9.4a | Screenshot — element scrolled into view | Select an element below the fold → camera | Page scrolls element into view first, then captures cropped image — never returns a blank or off-screen capture |
| 9.5  | Computed CSS overlay | Click `</>` | Slide-up overlay shows the element's computed CSS block; **Copy** copies the full block to clipboard (paste into a text file → 10+ properties) |
| 9.6  | Multi-select toggle | Click multi-select icon → click 3 elements on the page | Each selected element gets a dashed outline; header shows `3 selected` chip |
| 9.7  | Multi-select fan-out | With 3 selected, edit a property | Property applied to all 3 elements; Changes tab shows ONE row labelled `multi-select` with count `3 elements`. Must hold for **every** edit path, including the ones that write several longhands at once: the uniform Margin / Padding fields, Stroke colour / weight, and the Stroke add / remove / reorder buttons |
| 9.8  | Multi-select Esc | Press Esc with multi-select active | Multi-select tears down first; second Esc deselects |
| 9.9  | Freeze animations | Select an element → Design tab → **Motion** section header → click the circle-pause toggle (or `Alt+P` from anywhere) | The Motion-section toggle shows active state; CSS animations + transitions + WAAPI instances + `<video>` pause across the page; toggle again to resume |
| 9.10 | Undo / Redo | Make change → `Ctrl/⌘+Z` → `Ctrl/⌘+⇧+Z` | Reverts then re-applies (style, DOM, text, visibility all reversible) |
| 9.11 | Comment-only group delete | Add one comment to an otherwise unchanged element → Changes → click the group's red trash button | Confirmation appears; Cancel keeps the comment and pin. Repeat and confirm: both the row and pin disappear and stay gone after refresh |
| 9.12 | Layers empty copy | Open Layers before the tree arrives (or on an empty body) | Copy reads "No layers yet. The page tree appears here once the page is ready." — not "Click the inspector icon…" |

---

## Phase 10 — Bottom bar (Copy as Prompt / Send to Agent)

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 10.1 | Disabled with no changes | Open a fresh page | Both buttons disabled |
| 10.2 | Disabled while previewing | Click View Original | Both buttons disabled (banner explains) |
| 10.3 | Copy as Prompt format — header | Make any change → Copy as Prompt | Clipboard opens with `# Visual changes — {{page title}}` then `<{{page url}}>` on the next line (title falls back to `untitled` when the page has none). No boilerplate above the heading |
| 10.4 | Copy as Prompt format — body | Make 3 style + 1 text + 1 DOM change → Copy as Prompt | Changes sit under a `## Changes` heading, one bullet `- {label}: {detail}` each, ordered chronologically. Only the documented sections appear (`## Tokens changed`, `## Comments`, `## Design tokens used` — each omitted when empty); no code fences, no "How to apply" prose, no framework section |
| 10.5 | Style grouping per element | Edit two properties on the same `.btn` | Single bullet groups them: `- button.btn: padding 8px → 12px; border-radius 4px → 8px` |
| 10.6 | Text change format — inline diff | Edit part of a paragraph's text | Bullet reads `- {label} text: {inline diff}` in git word-diff notation — `[-removed-]`, `{+added+}`, unmarked = unchanged, `…` = elided unchanged run (a few words of context each side). A one-line legend under `## Changes` explains the markers (and says not to write them into the text). A total rewrite (no shared words) or an oversized edit falls back to `text → "{new}"` |
| 10.7 | DOM change format | Duplicate / delete / move an element | Bullet reads `- {label} duplicated` (or `deleted` / `moved` / `inserted`) |
| 10.7a | Move conveys origin → destination + chronology | Edit a style on `.card` → drag it to another parent in Layers → edit another style → Copy as Prompt | Move bullet reads `- {label} moved: {oldParent}[i] → {newParent}[j]`; the pre-move style bullet appears BEFORE the move line and the post-move one AFTER it; ambiguous labels (e.g. `div.card` matching several nodes) carry the full post-move selector in parens; MCP `get_changes` shows the same `origin`/`destination` on the move record and live (post-move) selectors on every change |
| 10.8 | Comment lines | Add a comment | Bullet reads `- note on {selector}: {text}` |
| 10.9 | Empty state | Copy as Prompt with no changes | Both the button gate (10.1) and this fallback key off the same empty ledger, so the fallback isn't reachable from the UI — verify by reading `exportMarkdown`, not by clicking. When hit, output is the two header lines from 10.3, a blank line, then `(no changes recorded yet)` |
| 10.10 | Send to Agent — connected | MCP connected → click Send to Agent | Button shows "Sent!" + success toast; agent's next `get_changes` includes a `handoff` field with `requestedAt` / `pageUrl` |
| 10.11 | Send to Agent — running, no agent | Server running but no agent → click | Instructions overlay: "no coding agent has attached yet", points to the MCP page + `/design-mode`; "Open MCP settings" button lands on the MCP page |
| 10.12 | Send to Agent — local offline | No local server in Local mode → click | Instructions overlay with `claude mcp add design-mode …` registration hint; button styled enabled (accent), not greyed out |
| 10.13 | Send to Agent — cloud, no token | Cloud mode without token → click | Instructions overlay pointing to the MCP page's "Connect to Cloud" |
| 10.14 | Handoff cleared | Send to Agent → Clear All → agent calls `get_changes` | No `handoff` field in the response |
| 10.15 | Breakpoint tag — mobile/tablet | Narrow the browser so the **page** viewport is < 768px → edit a style → Copy as Prompt | The change bullet ends with `_(mobile · {width}px)_`; a one-line legend appears once under `## Changes` explaining the tag. 768–1023px tags as `tablet`. Works with the side panel open (width = page render width, not window) |
| 10.16 | Breakpoint tag — desktop untagged | At ≥ 1024px viewport → edit a style → Copy as Prompt | No breakpoint tag on the bullet; no legend line (desktop is the implicit default) |
| 10.17 | Breakpoint tag — grouped / mixed | Edit two props on one element at mobile width, then (resize to tablet) edit a third → Copy as Prompt | The grouped bullet tags the narrowest width when uniform; if the group spans breakpoints it lists them narrowest-first, e.g. `_(mobile, tablet)_` |
| 10.18 | Breakpoint in `get_changes` | Edit at mobile width → agent calls `get_changes` | The style/text/DOM record carries `viewportWidth` + `breakpoint: "mobile"` |

## Phase 11 — MCP server (local + cloud)

The local server lives in `packages/mcp-local`; the cloud relay in `packages/mcp-cloud` (deployed
at `https://mcp.designmode.app`). Both expose the **same eight MCP tools**.

### 11.A — Local mode (`npm start` in `packages/mcp-local`)

| #     | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 11.1  | Server starts | `cd packages/mcp-local && npm start` | ASCII banner; eight tools listed: `get_changes`, `apply_changes`, `set_change_status`, `mark_comment_resolved`, `clear_changes`, `get_session_summary`, `export_changes`, `get_screenshot`; WebSocket bridge on `ws://localhost:9960` (or the configured port) |
| 11.2  | Port conflict — foreign occupant | Another (non-Design Mode) process on 9960 | Clean error that the occupant is not Design Mode; process is left running; suggests stopping it yourself or `DM_PORT=9961`. Never auto-killed |
| 11.2a | Second MCP client attaches | Start a second `npm start` while the first is still running | Second process attaches to the owner (does not exit on EADDRINUSE); MCP tools proxy to the owner; WebSocket stays on the first process |
| 11.2b | Owner survival + shared state | Stop the second process; call `get_changes` from a third client | Owner still listens on 9960; extension stays connected; session state is the owner's |
| 11.2c | Owner failover | Start two MCP clients, stop the first process (the owner), then call `get_changes` from the surviving client | The surviving attacher claims the same port, logs that it is now the owner, and serves the tool without requiring an app restart; the extension reconnects to that port |
| 11.2d | MCP client EOF | Start the built CLI on an unused `DM_PORT` with piped stdin; close stdin while an extension socket is connected | Process exits promptly and releases its port; no orphaned companion remains |
| 11.2e | Attached client EOF | Start an owner and an attached client on an unused port; close only the attacher's stdin | Attacher exits; owner stays alive and continues serving other clients |
| 11.2f | Startup EOF and detached start | Close piped stdin immediately, then repeat with stdin redirected from `/dev/null` | Both processes exit promptly without leaving a bridge; startup does not miss the EOF |
| 11.2g | Interactive start and signals | Run `npm start` from an interactive terminal; send SIGINT or SIGTERM | Companion stays alive during interactive use, then exits promptly and releases its own resources on either signal |
| 11.3  | Extension connects | Side panel open + auto-connect on (default) | Green dot in MCP indicator |
| 11.4  | `get_changes` | Invoke from agent | Returns `{ pageUrl, pageTitle, styleChanges[], textChanges[], domChanges[], cssBlock, comments[] }` |
| 11.5  | `apply_changes` | Push styles from agent: `{ changes: [{ elementId, styles: { color: 'red' } }] }` | Styles apply live on the page; row appears in Changes tab |
| 11.5a | `get_changes` exposes ids | After an edit, invoke `get_changes` | `items[]` lists each change with a stable `id` + `status: "todo"` |
| 11.5b | `set_change_status` | `{ status: 'in_progress' }` then `{ status: 'resolved', ids: ['<id>'] }` | Changes tab shows a WIP/DONE badge per row; resolved rows dim; Status sub-filter (To-do / In progress / Resolved) narrows the list; resolving a comment id flips it to resolved |
| 11.6  | `clear_changes` | Invoke | All changes cleared; Changes tab empties |
| 11.7  | `get_session_summary` | Invoke (side panel open on a page) | Returns `{ extensionConnected, activeSessions ≥ 1, sessions[] (non-empty), totalStyleChanges, totalTextChanges, totalComments }` |
| 11.8  | `export_changes` — formats | Invoke each: `format: 'css'` / `'tailwind'` / `'scss'` / `'jsx'` | Each returns the equivalent format of the current changes |
| 11.9  | `export_changes` — empty | Invoke with no changes | `"No changes to export."` |
| 11.10 | `get_screenshot` — viewport | Invoke without selector/elementId | Returns base64 PNG of the visible viewport |
| 11.11 | `get_screenshot` — element | Pass `selector` or `elementId` (`dm-*`) | Returns base64 PNG of just that element; ambiguous selectors fail with a candidate list |
| 11.11b | `get_screenshot` — comment region | Draw a region comment → from `get_changes` take its `id` → `get_screenshot({ commentId })` | Returns a PNG cropped to the region rectangle (or the element for element comments), as an image block, with **no DM overlays/bands/pins**. Off-screen region → friendly "scroll into view" error |
| 11.11c | `get_screenshot` — clean capture | Select an element with margin/padding (bands showing) → `get_screenshot` | The PNG contains no red/green bands, selection outline, guides, or pins |
| 11.12 | `get_changes` — comments carry id/region | Add an element comment + a region comment, then invoke | `comments[]` entries include `id`; the region comment has a `region: {x,y,w,h}` and `selector: "region"` |
| 11.13 | `mark_comment_resolved` | Pass a comment `id` from `get_changes` with `resolved: true` | Returns success; the page pin turns grey + struck-through, the Changes-tab row shows Resolved, with no panel reload |
| 11.14 | `mark_comment_resolved` — unknown id | Pass a non-existent id | `isError` with "No comment found with id …" |

### 11.B — Cloud mode

| #     | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 11.20 | Mode switch | MCP page → mode "Cloud" | URL field defaults to `https://mcp.designmode.app`; tenant + token fields appear |
| 11.21 | Register token | Open the cloud landing page → register → copy token + tenant ID | Token + tenant ID stored locally; indicator turns green when both present |
| 11.22 | Send to Agent | With agent connected to the cloud relay → click Send to Agent | Agent receives changes via the cloud bridge |
| 11.23 | Self-hosted | Mode "Self-hosted" → enter your Vercel URL | Same protocol as Cloud; works against any deployment of the `mcp-cloud` package |
| 11.24 | Cloud `get_changes` items[] | Make a style + comment, then cloud `get_changes` | Response includes `items[]` with stable `id` + `kind` + `status`, matching local |
| 11.25 | Cloud `get_session_summary` | Invoke with the side panel open | Returns `{ extensionConnected, activeSessions, sessions[], totalStyleChanges, totalTextChanges, totalDomChanges, totalComments, pendingHandoff }` |

---

## Phase 12 — data-dm-id system regression suite

This phase covers the load-bearing element-identity work added late in the v1.x cycle
(`packages/extension/src/content/change-tracker.ts` rule scoping; `html-editor.ts` clone
markers). Scoping rules to a stable per-element id is what stops edits to the original from
bleeding to duplicates and back.

| #     | Test | Steps | Expected |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 12.1  | Override stylesheet exists | Make any style edit → DevTools → `<head>` | A `<style id="dm-applied-styles">` element appears with rules of the form `[data-dm-id="X"][data-dm-id] { prop: val !important; }` |
| 12.2  | Override beats page CSS | On a Tailwind / heavily-styled site (Stripe, Linear), edit `color`, `background-color`, `padding`, `font-size` on a styled element | Each change paints immediately. (Pre-fix `(0,1,0)` selector would silently lose to chained-class page rules.) |
| 12.3  | Token round-trip | Pick a CSS-variable colour token | `var(--token)` lands on the element; Changes tab row shows the literal `var(--token)` value |
| 12.4  | Duplicate doesn't inherit edits | Duplicate an element → edit `color` on the original | Original repaints; duplicate stays at the original colour (rules are id-scoped) |
| 12.5  | Edit duplicate doesn't bleed back | Same setup → edit `padding` on the duplicate | Duplicate updates; original stays unchanged |
| 12.6  | Reload survives both | After 12.4 + 12.5, reload | Both elements re-appear with their respective edits intact |
| 12.7  | Clear All revives & cleans markers | Clear All | Both revert; `dm-clone` and `dm-clone-<id>` marker classes are stripped |
| 12.8  | Import a JSON export | Export changes from a tab → switch tab → Import | DOM mutations replay first (duplicates + inserts before moves before deletes), then text changes, then style rules. No "missing parent" warnings |
| 12.9  | Move-dedup | Drag a layer 3 times in Layers tab | Only ONE move record exists in Changes tab — the most recent destination — and the original `origin` is preserved so Clear All puts it back at the very first parent |

---

## Phase 13 — Cross-feature regressions

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 13.1 | Hover doesn't override Selected | Select element X, hover element Y | Indicator stays "Selected" with X's data |
| 13.2 | Persistence on URL revisit | Edit `/about`, navigate `/pricing`, navigate back | Edits on `/about` are still visible |
| 13.3 | Reload extension mid-session | `chrome://extensions` → reload Design Mode | Extension reloads cleanly; saved session changes still replay |
| 13.4 | CSP-strict site | Open a site with strict CSP (e.g. github.com) | Side panel still works; hover / select / inline edits succeed |
| 13.5 | Color picker preserves cursor | Type partial hex in the inline picker | Cursor stays in the input; morphdom doesn't blur it on render |

---

## Phase 15 — Floating panel window (pop-out / pin on top / dock-back)

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 15.1 | Pop out | In the side panel header click the **external-link** icon | A chrome-less floating window opens with the full panel UI, bound to the originating tab; the side panel closes (best-effort). Design mode stays active on the tab — no overlay flicker |
| 15.2 | Floating edits target the bound tab | In the floating window, select an element / apply a style / add a comment | Changes apply to the bound tab's page and show in its Changes tab |
| 15.3 | Survives browser-tab switch | With the floating window open, switch to a different browser tab, then act in the floating window | It still controls the original bound tab (not the now-active tab) |
| 15.4 | Bounds remembered | Resize/move the floating window, close it, pop out again | The new window restores the last size/position (`dm-popout-bounds`) |
| 15.5 | Dock back | In the floating window click the **panel-right** icon | The native side panel reopens for the bound tab and the floating window closes; design mode stays active (no flicker) |
| 15.6 | Close floating window | Close the floating window via its OS close button (no dock-back) | Design mode deactivates on the bound tab only (other tabs/surfaces unaffected) |
| 15.7 | Bound tab closed | Pop out for tab A, then close tab A | The orphaned floating window closes automatically |
| 15.8 | No cross-talk (multi-surface) | Side panel controlling tab A in window 1 + a floating window for tab B | Selecting in tab A updates only tab A's panel; the tab-B window is unaffected (per-tab `targetTabId` routing + `_dmTab` broadcast filter) |
| 15.9 | MCP in floating mode | With an agent connected, run `get_changes`/`apply_changes` while popped out | They target the bound tab exactly as in the docked side panel |
| 15.10 | Pin on top | In the floating window header click the **picture-in-picture** icon | An always-on-top PiP window opens with the full panel UI; the floating window minimizes and shows a "Panel is pinned on top" placeholder. The PiP window stays above the inspected page and other apps |
| 15.11 | Pinned edits target the bound tab | In the PiP window, select an element / apply a style / add a comment | Changes apply to the bound tab's page exactly as in the floating window |
| 15.12 | Unpin to floating | Click the accent-styled **picture-in-picture** icon in the PiP header (or close the PiP via its own ✕) | The PiP window closes; the floating window un-minimizes with the full panel UI; design mode stays active (no flicker) |
| 15.13 | Dock back from PiP | Click the **panel-right** icon in the PiP header | The native side panel reopens for the bound tab; the PiP window AND the floating window close; design mode stays active (no flicker) |
| 15.14 | Back to side panel from placeholder | Restore the minimized floating window while pinned and click **Back to side panel** | Same as 15.13 |
| 15.15 | Size remembered + floor | Resize the PiP window, unpin, pin again | The new PiP window restores the last size (`dm-pip-size`), never smaller than 320×400; squeezing it narrower scrolls horizontally instead of breaking layout |
| 15.16 | Opener killed while pinned | Close the minimized floating window from the Dock/taskbar while pinned | The PiP window dies with it (its opener unloaded); design mode deactivates on the bound tab only |
| 15.17 | Minimize doesn't clobber bounds | Pin (floating window minimizes), unpin, dock back, pop out again | The floating window restores its pre-pin size/position — the minimize never overwrote `dm-popout-bounds` |
| 15.18 | Unsupported Chrome | On a Chrome build without Document PiP | The Pin on top button is absent from the floating header; if `requestWindow` throws, a toast explains and the button disappears permanently (`dm-pip-unsupported`) |
| 15.19 | Launch = Floating | Settings → Launch → Floating, close the panel, click the toolbar icon (or Alt+D) | A floating pop-out opens via `windows.create`; the docked side panel does **not** open from the toolbar |
| 15.20 | Launch = Pin on top | Settings → Launch → Pin on top, close surfaces, click the toolbar icon | A floating opener appears with a focused **Pin on top** CTA (not an auto-opened PiP). One click calls `requestWindow` and pins. Dismissing continues as a normal floating window |
| 15.21 | Launch PiP unsupported | Same as 15.20 on a Chrome without Document PiP (or after `dm-pip-unsupported`) | Stays in the floating window; a toast explains Pin on top isn’t available |
| 15.22 | Launch reset | Set Launch to Floating, then Reset settings | Launch returns to Side panel; next toolbar click opens the docked panel |
| 15.23 | Launch survives a sleeping service worker | For Side panel, Floating, and Pin on top, stop the extension service worker from `chrome://serviceworker-internals`, then click the toolbar icon and repeat with `Alt+D`; repeat the toolbar action in Firefox | Chrome opens the configured surface without losing the launch gesture or briefly opening another surface; Firefox opens its sidebar synchronously |

---

## Phase 16 — Local files (file://)

Precondition: "Allow access to file URLs" toggle OFF for Design Mode in `chrome://extensions` (the default).

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 16.1 | Blocked guidance card | Open a local `.html` file (`file://`) and open the side panel | A "Local file" card with numbered steps replaces the editing UI (no Layers/Design/Changes tabs); Settings/Help still open from the header |
| 16.2 | Settings shortcut button | Click **Open extension settings** on the card | A new tab opens at `chrome://extensions/?id=<extension id>` |
| 16.3 | Editing after enabling | Turn the toggle ON (extension reloads), reopen the panel on the file tab | Full editing UI; inspect/select/edit/undo work; header shows the file name (e.g. `test.html`) |
| 16.4 | Navigate pinned tab to file:// | Toggle OFF again. Open the panel on an http(s) tab, then navigate that tab to the file URL | The guidance card appears; navigating back to the http(s) page restores the editing UI |
| 16.5 | Pop-out parity | Repeat 16.1 in the floating pop-out window | Same guidance card behaviour |
| 16.6 | Wrapped-artifact notice + wrapper opt-in | With file access ON, open a page whose whole UI is inside `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc="…">` (e.g. a saved artifact export) | Layers **and** Design tabs show a "This page wraps a sandboxed HTML artifact" notice (dashed-square icon) explaining the wrapped content can't be reached, with an **Inspect wrapper HTML** button. Clicking it bypasses the notice and shows the normal Layers/Design tree for the outer wrapper document. Not triggered by same-origin / `allow-same-origin` iframes or small incidental iframes; opt-in resets when navigating to a non-wrapped page |

---

## Phase 17 — Matching layers

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 17.1 | Check | Select a repeated element (card title, button); tick **Matching layers** in the Selected row (left of the CSS button) | Dashed overlays on all matches; "N selected" badge appears; success toast names the count |
| 17.2 | Fan-out | With the box ticked, change a style (e.g. color) | Every match updates; Changes tab shows one row per element (grouped) |
| 17.3 | Uncheck | Untick the box | Overlays clear; back to single selection |
| 17.4 | Reset on reselect | Tick the box, then select a different element | Checkbox resets to unticked for the new element |
| 17.5 | No matches | Select a unique element (e.g. the only `h1`) and tick | Error toast "No other matching layers"; checkbox stays unticked |

---

## Phase 14 — Website (docs site)

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 14.1 | Build clean | `npm run build:website` | No type errors |
| 14.2 | Landing page | Visit `/` | Header (icon + "Design Mode" + GitHub button + browser-adaptive install button — "Add to Chrome" / "Add to Firefox"), divider, hero, then sections: How you use it, Three panels, Other features, Copy as Prompt, MCP, Install, Licensing |
| 14.3 | Demo route | Visit `/demo` at widths below and above 768px | Mobile shows desktop-extension guidance after the hero and hides the walkthrough; desktop shows the interactive left nav and step targets; neither viewport has page-level horizontal overflow |
| 14.4 | MCP route | Visit `/mcp` | MCP setup / docs page |
| 14.5 | Anchor scroll | Click the install button ("Add to Chrome" / "Add to Firefox") | Page scrolls to `#install` |
| 14.6 | GitHub button | Click GitHub icon | Opens repo in a new tab |
| 14.7 | Favicon | Hard reload | Browser tab icon is the Design Mode logo (matches `/icon.png`) |
| 14.8 | 720px column | Inspect at desktop width | Article + footer are both 720px wide and centered |
| 14.9 | Manrope font | Inspect any text | `font-family` resolves to Manrope first |
| 14.10 | Static OG image | View `/`'s `<head>` (or unfurl the URL in Slack/iMessage) | `og:image` and `twitter:image` resolve to the static `/og-image.png` (not the old dynamic `opengraph-image` route) |
| 14.11 | New content routes | Visit `/about`, `/faq`, `/contact`, `/use-cases`, `/compare`, `/docs`, `/blog` | Each returns 200 and renders (hero + related-links / persona blocks); no console errors |
| 14.12 | Dynamic detail routes | Open one `/use-cases/<slug>`, `/compare/<slug>`, `/docs/<slug>`, `/blog/<slug>` (slugs listed in `sitemap.ts`) | Renders the entry sourced from `content/*.ts`; an unknown slug 404s |
| 14.13 | sitemap.xml | Visit `/sitemap.xml` | Lists the 12 root routes + every use-cases / compare / docs / blog slug, all under `https://designmode.app` |
| 14.14 | robots.txt | Visit `/robots.txt` | `Allow: /` for `*`; LLM crawlers explicitly allowed (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, …); `Sitemap:` points to `/sitemap.xml` |
| 14.15 | llms.txt | Visit `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` | Both serve plain-text site / product summaries |
| 14.16 | Web app manifest | Visit `/manifest.webmanifest` | Serves valid JSON (name, icons, theme) |
| 14.17 | JSON-LD structured data | View source on `/`, a `/compare/<slug>`, and `/faq` | `<script type="application/ld+json">` present (e.g. SoftwareApplication / FAQPage / Article) and valid JSON |
| 14.18 | New nav + footer links | Open any page | Navbar / footer expose the new sections (FAQ, Use cases, Compare, Docs, Blog) and navigate correctly |

---

## Phase F — Firefox parity (runtime `IS_FIREFOX` divergences)

Same `dist/` as Chrome — build once (`npm run build:extension`), then load it in
Firefox 121+ via `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → **Load Temporary Add-on**
→ pick `packages/extension/dist/manifest.json` (or `npm run dev:firefox`, which
launches Firefox with the add-on via `web-ext run`). Open a non-trivial site and
re-walk the core phases; this phase only lists the **Firefox-specific** deltas —
everything not listed here must behave exactly as on Chrome.

| #    | Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| F.1  | Add-on loads | Load the temporary add-on | Icon appears in the toolbar; no manifest error in the Browser Console (`data_collection_permissions` may log the advisory `KEY_FIREFOX_UNSUPPORTED_BY_MIN_VER` — expected) |
| F.2  | Sidebar opens (toolbar) | Click the Design Mode toolbar button | The panel opens as Firefox's **native sidebar** (left-docked), not a right-side panel |
| F.3  | Sidebar opens (View menu) | View → Sidebar → Design Mode | Toggles the same sidebar |
| F.4  | `Alt+D` toggles sidebar | Press `Alt+D` | Sidebar opens / closes (routed through `sidebarAction.open()`, not `sidePanel`) |
| F.5  | Core editing parity | Inspect an element, edit a style, add a comment, check the Changes tab | Identical to Chrome — selection, live style apply, comment pin, and change rows all work |
| F.6  | Pop-out absent | Look at the sidebar header | The **external-link** (pop-out) icon is **not present** (Chrome-only; no `sidePanel`/`windows` popup surface on Firefox) |
| F.7  | Pin-on-top absent | Look at the sidebar header | The **picture-in-picture** icon is **not present** (Chrome-only; no Document PiP on Firefox) |
| F.8  | Eyedropper hidden | Open Fill / a colour control | The whole-screen **Pick** (eyedropper) button is **absent**; HSV picker, site-token list, and hex/RGB input still work (no `EyeDropper` API on Firefox) |
| F.9  | File-access button target | Help / local-file guidance → the settings button | Opens **`about:addons`** (not `chrome://extensions`) |
| F.10 | Contribute review link | Open the Contribute panel → the store review link | Points at the **AMO** listing (`addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/design-mode-add-on/`), not the Chrome Web Store |
| F.11 | Share text is Firefox-flavoured | Contribute panel → share action | Share copy references Firefox / AMO, not Chrome |
| F.12 | Unscriptable `about:` page | Open the sidebar on `about:addons` | Disabled / empty state, no "could not establish connection" console spam (mirrors Phase 0.12) |
| F.13 | `web-ext lint` clean | `npm run lint:extension` | 0 errors (the ~30 documented warnings are expected) |
| F.14 | Launch setting omitted | Open Settings | There is **no** Launch / Side panel / Floating / Pin on top control. Toolbar and Alt+D always open the sidebar |

---

## Phase 18 — Authored sizing and agent review workflow

| Test | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 18.1 Authored sizing | Inspect `auto`, percentage, intrinsic, `calc()` and token-derived widths/heights; resize the viewport. | Authored value and computed-size hint remain distinct; selecting/blur without editing creates no override. |
| 18.2 Cascade and fallback | Inspect important inline styles, media rules, layers, container rules, inaccessible sheets and logical sizes. | Only supported winning declarations appear as authored; ambiguous cases use an explicitly computed fallback, never an invented author value. |
| 18.3 Sizing edits | Edit W/H, reselect Fixed on a relative length, Undo, Redo, reload and drag resize. | Fields preserve authored units; Fixed does not convert an existing relative length. Drag preview ticks in pixels and commits fixed pixels; selection refresh clears the preview. Changes use the normal managed stylesheet and undo path. |
| 18.4 Component grouping | Change two elements in one component and an identically named component in another source; switch Elements ↔ Components. | Separate source identities, original element selectors/actions and change counts preserved; selection does not mutate changes. |
| 18.5 Missing component metadata | Review a production build, a deleted element, token edits and comments. | Unattributed/source-unverified labels are honest; tokens retain scopes; comments stay available. |
| 18.6 Group search and actions | Search a component/file, sort, filter, select rows, revert one element, and preview original. | Search finds source hints; order inside each component follows sort; actions keep their original scope. |
| 18.7 Live feedback rounds (Local) | Start the agent wait, edit, Send, implement, then wait and Send again. | Waiting → Implementing → Waiting; each Send produces a distinct structured round; no automatic resend. |
| 18.8 Stop and disconnect | Stop while waiting/implementing; disconnect, reload or close the inspected page. | Pending waits settle; stopped rounds cannot restart implicitly; Stop explains that an agent's already-running command cannot be killed by the extension. |
| 18.9 Concurrent agents | Have two MCP clients request the same live session. | No duplicated delivery or silent ownership takeover; timeout and cancellation are bounded. |
| 18.10 Other MCP modes | Select Cloud/Self-hosted and Send. | Existing one-shot handoff remains usable; Local-only feedback controls do not imply cloud support. |
| 18.11 Guided setup | Run setup against disposable JSON/JSONC agent-config fixtures; inspect preview; decline then approve; repeat. | No writes on decline; approved writes preserve unrelated config and environment settings, warn before normalising comments, back up original files and are idempotent. |
| 18.12 Setup safety | Use invalid JSON, conflicting entries, symlink targets, unsupported client and unavailable server. | Actionable errors; no destructive overwrite; diagnostic checks do not leak credentials. |

## Sign-off

After every full pass, tag the run in the project notes:

```
vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD
✓ All phases pass (Chrome)
✓ Phase F parity pass (Firefox)
✓ npm run build:extension clean
✓ npm run verify passed all automated checks
```

If a row fails, file a short bug note, fix it, and re-run only the affected phase before
publishing.
